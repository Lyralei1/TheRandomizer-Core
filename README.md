# TheRandomizer-Core
Source code of Lyralei's Randomizer mod. You don't need to clone the code to make your own modules, this repository merely exists as a proper reference to read from. The Core is merely the framework of the whole system. You may ONLY edit this if I'm retired!


## Using the Core Module for your own Custom Modules.
For this, I've made a seperate Template Repository which you can clone and use to your liking! (or reference ;)) 

The Instructions on how to use it are all included in the Module Template template: https://github.com/Lyralei1/ModuleTemplate-Clone-Me/blob/master/ModuleTemplate/RenameMeModuleName.cs
